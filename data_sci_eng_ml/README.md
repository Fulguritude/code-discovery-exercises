# Data literacy

This is a set of ressources meant to help quickly teach data literacy to people of all levels and interests.

It is a revamp (and translation) of the pedagogical material that I had made for various university students. It started with master's students of "UX and design" at the *Ecole de Design Nantes-Atlantique*, and more recently, I used it for master's students in data science and engineering at the *Estiam*.

The goal of this course (of my own design), originally, was to give a decent amount data and programming literacy to people with backgrounds that might even be lacking high school math. It was mostly centered around data science and ML, but could serve as a guide to the most motivated students to be able to pursue general programming, data science, data engineering, and machine learning.

The goal for the revamp, and when working for the Estiam, was to produce a free platform to help guide and prepare anyone interested in learning general data science and data engineering on their own.

Ideally, it should even provide people who work with data technicians, but themselves aren't data-savvy (business, legal, HR, design, etc), with a way to learn the parts of the technical domain that are relevant to them (for example, to try and understand meetings better and whatnot).

Of interest are:

  - the lexicon, which presents some thematic lists of concepts that relate to computer science, professional work in data, machine learning, mathematics, design, system design, network engineering, etc.

  - the jupyter worksheets, which would present fundamental programming, data science, data visualization, and machine learning concepts, in a pedagogically decent order (TODO: finish cleaning, and translate).


# Programming literacy

There are a few exercises to help gain basic programming literacy in the series of worksheets. However, it is certainly better to obtain "more than the basics" before diving deep into data science and data engineering. For a more extensive approach to programming literacy, useful for data science etc, you are encouraged to look for the "Python" section at the root of this repo.
