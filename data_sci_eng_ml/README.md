# Data literacy

This is a revamp (and translation) of the pedagogical material that I had made for university students of "UX and design" at l'Ecole de Design Nantes-Atlantique.

The goal of this course (of my own design) was to give a decent amount data and programming literacy to people with backgrounds that might be lacking high school math. It would serve as a guide to the most motivated students to be able to pursue programming, data science, data engineering, and machine learning.

Of interest are:

  - the lexicon, which presents some thematic lists of concepts that relate to computer science, professional work in data, machine learning, mathematics, design, etc. 

  - the jupyter worksheets, which would present fundamental programming, data science and machine learning concepts, in a pedagogically decent order (TODO: translate and clean).
